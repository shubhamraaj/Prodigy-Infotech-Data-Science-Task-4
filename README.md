## Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for my data science internship project at `Prodigy Infotech`, focusing on Twitter sentiment analysis. The project aims to analyze sentiment patterns in Twitter data to gain insights into public opinion and attitudes towards various topics, brands, and events.

## Dataset

The <a href = "https://github.com/shubhamraaj/Prodigy-Infotech-Data-Science-Task-4/blob/6b3ddc4a0dbdc77711a858c049a2af75570a50cc/Twitter%20Analysis.csv">`dataset`</a> used for this project consists of Twitter data collected from Kaggle.


## Conclusion

The sentiment analysis provides valuable insights into prevailing attitudes and opinions within the Twitter community regarding various topics. While negative sentiments appear to be more common overall, there is a diverse range of sentiments expressed across different topics. Understanding these sentiment trends can inform decision-making processes, marketing strategies, and community engagement efforts in both online and offline contexts.
